# 📊 Asset Tracker

A personal learning playground built using the MERN stack, inspired by the [TimeToProgram expense tracker tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQnbtnsYUho&t=843s). Instead of tracking income and expenses alone, this project evolves the concept into a real-time **asset tracker** — monitoring stocks, crypto, ETFs, and other holdings in one unified dashboard.

## 🚀 Purpose

This project supports my journey into mastering **React** and deepening my understanding of full-stack development. As I build, experiment, and iterate, it will become both a sandbox for growth and a practical portfolio piece reflecting my progress and curiosity.

## 🧠 What Makes It Different

Unlike traditional expense trackers, Asset Tracker is asset-centric — built for:

- 📈 Real-time visualization of all asset performance
- 🪙 Tracking diverse asset classes (stocks, crypto, ETFs, etc.), not just cash
- 🌐 Future integrations with APIs for live data feeds
- 🛠️ A flexible structure designed to grow with my skills

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- **MongoDB** — database for storing asset data
- **Express.js** — backend routing and logic
- **React.js** — dynamic frontend interface
- **Node.js** — server environment

## 🗂️ Project Status

Currently in active development as a personal learning tool. Expect incremental updates as I explore new React patterns, UI improvements, and data integrations.
